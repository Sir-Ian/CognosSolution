## Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Ian. I like making things that run faster, scale smarter, and cut the boring manual work.  
My wheelhouse: Python, data automation, APIs, and AI models you can actually deploy.  

By day: consulting (OneStream + Azure + data pipelines).  
By night: projects, music, and way too much time talking about cars.
